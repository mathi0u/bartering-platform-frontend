- [x] All services use environment configuration

### âœ… Railway Configuration
- [x] `Caddyfile` configured for static serving
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` configured for Railway deployment
- [x] `railway.json` configured with health checks
- [x] Health check endpoint available at `/health`

### âœ… Security & Performance

## Deployment Steps

1. **Final Test**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ./test-caddy-config.sh
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure Caddy deployment for Railway"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
   - Create new project from GitHub repo
   - Railway will auto-deploy using `nixpacks.toml`

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check deployment logs in Railway
   - Visit your Railway domain
   - Test `/health` endpoint
   - Verify API calls work with your backend

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] App loads successfully
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Item listing works
- [ ] Barter requests work
- [ ] File uploads work (if applicable)
- [ ] All routes accessible

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load speed < 3 seconds
- [ ] Static assets cached properly
- [ ] Gzip compression working
- [ ] No console errors

### API Integration Tests
- [ ] Backend API accessible
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Authentication tokens work
- [ ] Data persistence works

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify `package.json` dependencies
- Test build locally: `npm run build:prod`

**App Doesn't Load**
- Check Caddy logs in Railway
- Verify Caddyfile syntax
- Test health endpoint

**API Calls Fail**
- Check API URL in `environment.prod.ts`
- Verify backend CORS settings
- Check network tab in browser dev tools

**Static Assets Not Loading**
- Verify build output in `dist/frontend-app/browser/`
- Check Caddyfile root path
- Verify file permissions
